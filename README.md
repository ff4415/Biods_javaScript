##The Origin of Boids

Boids is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds to simulate the be­ 
havior of flocking birds. The name refers to the birdlike objects that populate the 
simulation. Instead of programming complex behavior for the boids, Reynolds pro­ 
vided three simple rules: 

Separation 
     Each boid should stay away from its flockmates to avoid overcrowding. 

Alignment 
     Each boid should move toward the average direction and with the average speed 
     of its flockmates. 

Cohesion 
     Each boid should move toward the average position of its flockmates.
