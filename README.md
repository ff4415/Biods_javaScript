##The Origin of Boids

Boids is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds to simulate the be­ 
havior of flocking birds. The name refers to the birdlike objects that populate the 
simulation. Instead of programming complex behavior for the boids, Reynolds pro­ 
vided three simple rules: 

####Separation 
     Each boid should stay away from its flockmates to avoid overcrowding. 

####Alignment 
     Each boid should move toward the average direction and with the average speed 
     of its flockmates. 

####Cohesion 
     Each boid should move toward the average position of its flockmates.
